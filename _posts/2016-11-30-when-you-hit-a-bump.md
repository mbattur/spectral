title: WHEN YOU HIT A BUMP
---

There will be numerous ups and downs while learning to code. 
At the beginning the swings are much more pronounced. Coding 
is surprisingly emotional activity. In one moment you will 
feel like you know so much and all your hard work is paying 
off. In other moment you will be surprised by how little things 
are tripping you up and be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of 
information you seem to need to store in your head. The good 
news is you learn that failing is big part of engineering and 
no one has all the info stored in their brain. I'm at the very 
beginning of my coding journey and the biggest adjustment 
I had to deal was to learn to fail majority of the time and 
get used to it. For most other professions you can't be successful 
by failing this much. But writing code is all about failure. 
You write your initial code wrong SO you will fail.

One thing that gives me hope during those down days I always 
resolve to study and code more. I always re-evaluate my approach, 
research other sources and revisit the topic several times. 
So when you go through several days of failure and slow 
progress I want you to decide to push even harder. If you're 
struggling even more than the usual it means you're at the 
next level and you have to go through it to advance. There 
will be hours of reading dry Stack Overflow posts and dryer 
documentations. This will seem fruitless and you almost feel 
like you're going backwards because the readings introduce 
brand new concepts. Just remember that you're learning new 
language, new culture and new way of thinking.
