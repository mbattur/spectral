title: WHY I STARTED
---
I got my undergrad in Economics, then MBA. Still I felt I was 
lacking a solid skill that can be useful to a company from day 
one. Frankly some people who were on same program as me seemed 
to be loud-mouth extraverts who lacks a any legitimate skill and 
faking their way through the whole thing. I wanted real skill 
and I wanted to compete in an environment that has minimal room 
for fakeness. 

Furthermore more an internship experience at a startup provided 
an opportunity to see the power of computer coding and software 
engineer. This “tech” startup had zero engineer, tons of sales 
people, and endless manual tasks that should have been automated a 
long time ago. The salespeople had all the power and the company 
was raising millions of dollars from venture capital. I saw the 
power just couple of able engineers could have in that company 
and make manual tasks more automated so these capable people can 
focus on more important tasks. I finally found a solid skill that 
I can pursue to learn. 

More I read and learned about computer coding and software development 
more I realized the power it had in the modern business. There were 
companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars and they had less 
than couple dozen of employees by the time for IPO or acquisition. 
That's the power of software and I wanted to be part of it. If a 
company hires me I want to make 5 or 10 times more contributions 
than person next to me and as far as I can tell being software 
developer is one of the legitimate ways of doing that.
