	<p>Learning to code can be a lonely endeavor. The problem you're facing 
	can seem like very unique that there is no answer on Stack Overflow or 
	Google. Amount of information one needs to observe can feel like too much 
	and growing more with every updates and new technologies. Or sometimes 
	you just want to talk to someone who is going through same thing as you 
	are. Here at CodeWasabi we are aiming to be that place, where developers 
	can share their knowledge, wisdom, tricks and many more.</p>
	
	<p>Here you can learn about developers around the world at different skill 
	levels. We will dive into problems they're facing, projects they are working 
	and technologies they are excited about. It's a gathering place where 
	information and encouragements can be found about all things developing.</p>
