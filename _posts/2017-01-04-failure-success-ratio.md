title: 92 PERCENT FAILURE, 2 PERCENT SUCCESS
---
6 percent sleep/fun time. Just kidding. The biggest adjustment someone 
like me needs to make is being comfortable with this or similar ratio. 
By definition, coding is succeeding by failing. I'm getting used to the 
idea but still have hard time during a long stretch of failures without 
success. That's when I try to redefine what success is so even tiny bit of 
something going right counts as success. It's the same concept when a 
basketball player having a bad shooting day she drives to the hoop 
aggressively to get fouled and shoot free throw. After seeing couple 
of shots going through the net she will have confidence and start building 
on that success, however small it might be. 

So, when things get hairy for a long stretch of time redefine your success. 
Pass the easiest unit tests, write the simplest code and refactor it later. 
I still get freak out when the gap between successes gets bigger and I have 
to remind myself about the ratio and begin counting the ability to find my 
Github repository as success.
