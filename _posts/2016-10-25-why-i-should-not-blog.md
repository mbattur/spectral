title: WHY I SHOULD NOT BLOG
---


I’m a private person who prefers listening to others and learn from them than talking myself. This is perhaps partly due to my Asian background but I see talkative Asians all the time so I’m confused. I never got into any of the social media phenomenon believing if you're good friend of mine you are already know who I am and if not I’m not telling you who I am.

Also, I have great admiration for people who can write well and I know I will never reach their levels in this lifetime. I'm originally from Mongolia and came to the States when I was sixteen. I was never fully comfortable writing and speaking in English and still struggle to communicate as clearly as I want to. So please excuse all the grammar mistakes and incoherent sentences that will sure to follow. Hopefully it will get better as time passes.

But most importantly, my knowledge of the subject that I'm looking to write is subpar at best. I have started full-stack bootcamp (Bloc) on September 2015 and still annoyed by simple concepts and facts that trip me. From everything I read, listen and people I talk to one day everything will finally makes sense and “click”. I'm still waiting for the arrival of this clicking sound slowly vibrating my brain and everything thing in the world begin to make sense.

I found the urge to start a blog because learning to code was incredibly lonely endeavor despite having a great mentor and excellent support system at Bloc. Sometimes I would get so confused and defeated that I needed 15-20 minutes of break where I can read and learn about others who are going through the same thing. I wanted know how they are coping with it and their solutions and resources to make things a little bit easier for them. This is my attempt to create that little break for coders who in need for dust themselves up and continue cranking code.
