title: WHY I PICKED BLOC
---
From early 2015 I was increasingly convinced that I should be learning to code. I 
thought about going back to school to get a bachelor’s degree in computer science 
but have been hesitant to fully commit mostly due to the time and resources it would 
take. During both undergrad and grad school I was working full-time and sometimes 
multiple jobs. I remember getting 4-5 hours of sleep and always short on time, 
which wasn't fun. Fact that I kept coming up with excuses not to go back to 
school indicated that I would not go for it. 

Then I read an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/technology/code-academy-as-career-game-changer.html" target="_blank">article on NY times</a> about coding bootcamps and how they're getting 
more popular and legitimate option to learn to code. I began my search on bootcamps 
and their developments over past few years. I was excited about their progresses 
and abilities to provide essential skills in short amount of time. I talked to few 
people who were in tech industry and they seemed to not hate the idea and know people 
or two who went through bootcamp and changed their career successfully. I truly 
believed that bootcamps brutally concentrate on essential skills and typical CS 
degree program has lots of ice in the glass with that whiskey. 

After doing some research online I narrowed down to two bootcamps Dev Bootcamp and 
Bloc. The former is 12-week intensive program where you program 8-12 hours a day. 
The pace was extremely fast and one of the developer guys that I play basketball 
with thought it might be lots of cramming. Plus I had to take time off from work 
and that was increasingly difficult option. 

I thought “yes! Bloc is online bootcamp but they supplement it with 1-on-1 mentor 
and great support system “. I didn't mind studying in the evenings and weekends 
because my wife was doing the same for her CPA exam while working full-time. 
So that was my thinking in a nutshell. It was a hard decision to make at a time 
but once decided I pushed forward with full force. I will write more about the 
ups and downs of learning to code in upcoming posts, but in short I am overall 
happy with Bloc, its curriculum, my mentor, and support system they provide. 

By the way besides being its student I’m not affiliated or sponsored by Bloc in anyway.
