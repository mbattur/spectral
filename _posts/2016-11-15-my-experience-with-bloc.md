title: MY EXPERIENCE WITH BLOC
---
In this post I want to write a little about my experience with Bloc. Let's say 
a friend asking my honest opinion about the program and whether or not she should 
go with Bloc or some other program. 

First of all, I have no experience with in-person bootcamps like Dev Bootcamp 
or Flatiron School. So whatever I say about them would be closer to fiction. 
I am going to concentrate on MY experience knowing yours might be very different 
depending on your situation and mentor. 

MENTOR 

The most important thing is choosing the right mentor. This person will 
determine whether or not you going to finish the program successfully 
and you can find job afterwards. That's assuming you're dedicating the 
time and effort the program requires and it does require a lot of both. 
When it comes to a mentor you want to pick someone who gives a damn. 
All of the mentors are vetted for their technical skills and I assume 
qualified to teach the material. But there is a huge difference between 
someone who cares and someone who doesn't. I changed two mentors before I 
found my current mentor, Richard. My experience of learning to code was very 
different depending on my mentor. For some reason I was struggling to understand 
the concept of param and was overthinking the whole thing. When I told this 
to my second mentor I was directed to the specific part of the reading material. 
Shortly after that I changed mentor and Richard explained the concept to me in 
three different ways, including with real life example. 

MATERIAL 

Bloc creates its own program material and it's constantly updated. 
There are lots of links that leads to external reading material 
but that's given. It helps you to get familiar with reputable 
sources and navigate trove of online information on particular 
subject. Overall, the material gives you more than enough to 
each you the necessary language skills and particular technology. 
But like my basketball coach used to say if you want to get better 
the regular team practice is not enough. You have go out there and 
go little deeper on specific language, library or framework. Bottom 
line is I never felt Bloc material short-changed me in anyway. For 
the most part I needed to reread the checkpoints couple of times to 
begin to grasp a concept. 

Let's stop here and pick it up at next posts. I will discuss other 
parts of the program in details.
